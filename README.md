# My Personal Bot

A personal bot enriching GPT chatbot by using GPT3 API to get answers about your own content

## Features
- The bot can scan a pre-configured data source (currently a folder on your PC), and learn the content
- The bot will automatically learn each file that is added to the folder 
- The bot can then answer question about the content
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, WAV, MP3, MP4, WMV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/akiriati/PersonalGPT.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Generate a token at `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys` (It's free! ðŸ’¸)
4. Configure the bot by creating a `config-secrets.yaml` and put `OPENAI_KEY: <YOUR_KEY_HERE>`
5. Run the bot: `python chatbot.py bot`

## Getting started 
1. run `python chatbot.py teach --path "<PATH_TO_A_FOLDER_WITH_CONTENT>"`. This might a few seconds for each doc, and ~1 minute for every 30 minutes of sound/video 
2. run `python chatbot.py bot`

## Usage
- Use the bot and communicate about your content by running `python chatbot.py bot`
- Ask the bot single a question by running `python chatbot.py query --text "<YOUR_QUESTION_HERE>`
- Teach the bot the content of a folder / single file by running `python chatbot.py teach --path "<YOUR_PATH_HERE>`

## Autmoate folder
- You can also autmoate a folder to teach the bot the content of a new file when it is added to the folder. In Mac this can be done by using the Automator.app -> Folder Action -> Run Shell Script -> 
```
# Your Python program's path
program_path=<PATH_TO_CHATBOT>

# The filename of the newly added file
filename="$1"

# Run the Python program and pass the filename as an argument
python3 "$program_path" "teach" "--path" "$filename"
```
